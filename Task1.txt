Task1
1. I did.
2.	a. Community detection using CDI at module level may enable to identify novel marker genes relevant to human disorders. EEI can be used as a feature in clustering, which leads to increase of sensitivity and a better understanding of cell heterogeneity.
	b. The authors cultured glioblastoma stem-like cells and performed scRNA-seq.
3.	a.	(1) How can the robustness of EEI be explained theoretically?
		(2) Is it possible to use only the EEI feature in dimensionality reduction?
		(3) Can the indices (CDI and EEI) be improved to deal with expression patterns of more than two genes all at once? Is it significant?
	b.	optional
